# Explore-and-Summarize-Data
Project 6, Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree

***

## Description
In this project, I used R and applied exploratory data analysis techniques in a selected dataset (Financial Contributions to Presidential Campaigns for Texas) to discover relationships among multiple variables, and create explanatory visualizations illuminating distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

## Rubric

### Code Functionality
| CRITERIA                       | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                                       |
| ------------------------------ |----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Does the code work?          | All code is functional (e.g. No Error is produced and RMD document is not prevented from being knit.) |
| Does project utilize good coding practices?  | The project almost never uses repetitive code where a function would be more appropriate. The code references variables by name instead of using constants or column numbers. |

### Project Readability
| CRITERIA                                      | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------- |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Is the R code in the submitted RMD file commented in a way that is useful and not superfluous?            | All complex code is adequately explained with comments. It is always clear what the code is doing and how and why any unusual coding decisions were made.|
| Does the project code use formatting techniques (indents, spaces, line breaks, etc…) to improve readability?    | The code uses formatting techniques in a consistent and effective manner to improve code readability. All lines are shorter than 80 characters. |
| Is Markdown used to improve the presentation of the knitted HTML file? (e.g. section headers, text and paragraph spacing, document styles.                      | Conclusions should include not only statistical reasoning, but also practical reasoning for the situation.)   |

### Quality of Analysis
| CRITERIA                                      | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------- |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Is the data set explored in many ways?             | The project appropriately uses univariate, bivariate, and multivariate plots to explore most of the expected relationships in the data set. |
| Are questions and observations included as text throughout the analysis? (i.e. Every plot or set of related plots is followed by text interpreting the plot(s).)             | Questions and findings are placed between blocks of R code regularly so it is clear what the student was thinking throughout the analysis. |
|  Is the flow of the analysis easy to follow?            |  Reasoning is provided for the plots made throughout the analysis. Plots made follow a logical flow. Comments following plots accurately reflect the plots’ contents.|
|  Are there a variety of relevant visualizations and statistical summaries?            | The project contains at least 20 visualizations. The visualizations are varied and show multiple comparisons and trends. Relevant statistics (e.g. mean, median, confidence intervals, correlations) are computed throughout the analysis when an inference is made about the data. |
|  Is the data visualized using appropriate plots and parameter choices?            | Visualizations made in the project depict the data in an appropriate manner that allows plots to be readily interpreted. Choice of plot type, variables, and aesthetic parameters (e.g. bin width, color, axis breaks) is appropriate. |

### Final Plots and Summary
| CRITERIA                                      | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------- |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Has a Final Plots and Summary section been included in the project?             |  The project includes a Final Plots and Summary section containing three plots and commentary. All plots in this section reflect what has been explored in the main body of the analysis.|
| Are the final three plots varied and do they meet some of the following criteria?: Draw comparisons. Identify trends. Engage a wide audience. Explain a complicated finding. Clarify a gap between perception and reality. Enable the reader to digest large amounts of information.           | The plots are well chosen and the plots fulfill at least 2 of the criteria. The plots are varied and reveal interesting trends and relationships. |
|  Are the plots appropriate?            |  All plots have appropriately selected variables and are plotted in a way that accurately conveys the data/information (i.e findings in Final Plot 1 do not depend on the findings of Final Plot 2). |
| Are the plots polished?: are axes labeled? are units labeled on each axis? are plots titled? are all labels, titles, and units readable?  | All plots are labeled appropriately (axis labels, plot titles, axis units) and can be read and interpreted easily. Plots are scaled appropriately. |
| Are the plots explained?             | The reasoning and findings from each plot are explained and the text about each plot is descriptive enough to stand alone. Comments reflect the contents of the plots that they are associated with.  |

### Reflection
| CRITERIA                                      | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------- |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Has a Reflection section been included in the project?            | The project includes a Reflection section discussing the analysis performed. |
|  Does the section provide a written reflection of the analysis? Consider the following in your reflections: Where did I run into difficulties in the analysis? Where did I find successes? How could the analysis be enriched in future work (e.g. additional data and analyses)?  | The section reflects on how the analysis was conducted and reports on the struggles and successes throughout the analysis. The section provides at least one idea or question for future work. The section explains any important decisions in the analysis and how those decisions affected the analysis. |
